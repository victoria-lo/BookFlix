## Library Circulation System
- Used vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a simple library circulation system.

## What I Learn
- Build and edit DOM Elements
- Using built-in JS data structures (i.e. objects and arrays) to store data for DOM elements to display
- Add listeners and click events in JavaScript
- Navigating HTML elements via JavaScript
- Using querySelector to find HTML elements
- Build simple tables using HTML

## The Project
- Stores a collection of books and patrons
- Tracks which books are borrowed and which patrons are borrowing them
- Tracks when the books are returned
- Use book's unique ID to lookup and display book information when requested
