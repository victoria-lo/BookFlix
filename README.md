# BookFlix
## Library Circulation System
- 100DaysOfCode Day 1
- Using vanilla JavaScript to create a simple library circulation system.

## What I Learn:
- Build and edit DOM Elements, which using built-in JS data structures (i.e. objects and arrays) to store data that these DOM display.

## The Project
- Stores a collection of books and patrons
- Tracks which books are borrowed and which patrons are borrowing them
- Tracks when the books are returned
- Use book's unique ID to lookup and display book information when requested
