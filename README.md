## The Project
- Used vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a simple library circulation system.
- Stores a collection of books and patrons
- Tracks which books are borrowed and which patrons are borrowing them
- Tracks when the books are returned
- Use book's unique ID to lookup and display book information when requested
